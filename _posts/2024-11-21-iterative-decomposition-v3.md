There's a new demo page for v3 of the iterative audio decomposition model I've been working on.  
The model is small and hasn't had much (less than 24-hours) of training time so far, but doubles the 
duration of audio segments from the [prior model](https://blog.cochlea.xyz/machine-learning/2024/02/29/siam.html).
