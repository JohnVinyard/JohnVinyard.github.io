Happy Leap Day!  I've just [published some high-level details and sound reconstructions](/siam.html) from a newly-trained model that
decomposes musical audio into an easy-to-manipulate format:

![Sparse Interpretable Audio Model Architecture](https://matching-pursuit-repo-media.s3.amazonaws.com/vector_siam.drawio2.png "Sparse Interpretable Audio Model")

- event times and amplitudes
- time and amplitude-agnostic event vectors that describe a musical event
- A global context vector that determines room reverb

Different "axes" of the sound can be manipulated independently, and indivdual events can be played in isolation.
